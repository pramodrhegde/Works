            New features in CSS3 and HTML5 allow web developers to build increasingly elegant websites                 using very clean and semantic markup. It offers them exciting features like localStorage, and               using advanced CSS3 techniques to style it all. Sadly, it isn't quite as simple as that; the               many different levels of support for all these features across the entire browser landscape has             given many developers a headache. Since aspirin can't be distributed via https, alternative                 solutions had to be created. One such solution is Modernizr, a library that detects the                     availability of features in the current browser and makes that information available to the web             developer.
